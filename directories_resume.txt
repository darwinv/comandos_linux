Home Directory
-----------------------

Each user has a home directory, usually placed under /home. The /root (slash-root) directory on modern Linux systems is no more than the root user's home directory.

The /home directory is often mounted as a separate filesystem on its own partition, or even exported (shared) remotely on a network through NFS.

Sometimes you may group users based on their department or function. You can then create subdirectories under the /home directory for each of these groups. For example, a school may organize /home with something like the following:

/home/faculty/
/home/staff/
/home/students/



The /bin and /sbin Directories
----------------------------------

The /bin directory contains executable binaries, essential commands used in single-user mode, 
and essential commands required by all system users, such as:

ps 	Produces a list of processes along with status information for the system.
ls 	Produces a listing of the contents of a directory.
cp 	Used to copy files.


The /dev Directory
----------------------------

The /dev directory contains device nodes, a type of pseudo-file used by most hardware and software devices, except for network devices. This directory is:

    Empty on the disk partition when it is not mounted
    Contains entries which are created by the udev system, which creates and manages device nodes on Linux, creating them dynamically when devices are found. The /dev directory contains items such as:
                /dev/sda1 (first partition on the first hard disk)
                /dev/lp1 (second printer)
                /dev/dvd1 (first DVD drive)


The /var and /etc Directories
-----------------------------

The /var directory contains files that are expected to change in size and content as the system is running (var stands for variable) such as the entries in the following directories:

    System log files: /var/log
    Packages and database files: /var/lib
    Print queues: /var/spool
    Temp files: /var/tmp

The /var directory may be put in its own filesystem so that growth of the files can be accommodated and the 
file sizes do not fatally affect the system. 
Network services directories such as /var/ftp (the FTP service)
and /var/www (the HTTP web service) are also found under /var.

The /etc directory is the home for system configuration files. 
It contains no binary programs, although there are some executable scripts. 
For example, the file resolv.conf tells the system where to go on the network to obtain host
name to IP address mappings (DNS). Files like passwd,shadow and group for managing user 
accounts are found in the /etc directory. System run level scripts are found in subdirectories of /etc. 
For example, /etc/rc2.d contains links to scripts for entering and leaving run level 2. 
The rc directory historically stood for Run Commands. Some distros extend the contents of /etc. 
For example, Red Hat adds the sysconfig subdirectory that contains more configuration files.


The /boot Directory
----------------------------


The /boot directory contains the few essential files needed to boot the system. For every alternative kernel installed on the system there are four files:

    vmlinuz: the compressed Linux kernel, required for booting
    initramfs: the initial ram filesystem, required for booting, sometimes called initrd, not initramfs
    config: the kernel configuration file, only used for debugging and bookkeeping
    System.map: kernel symbol table, only used for debugging
    
 
The /lib and /media Directories
---------------------------------------


/lib contains libraries (common code shared by applications and needed for them to run) for the essential programs in /bin and /sbin. These library filenames either start with ld or lib, for example, /lib/libncurses.so.5.7.

Most of these are what are known as dynamically loaded libraries (also known as shared libraries or Shared Objects (SO)). On some Linux distributions there exists a /lib64 directory containing 64-bit libraries, while /lib contains 32-bit versions.

Kernel modules (kernel code, often device drivers, that can be loaded and unloaded without re-starting the system) are located in /lib/modules/<kernel-version-number>.

The /media directory is typically located where removable media, such as CDs, DVDs and USB drives are mounted. Unless configuration prohibits it, Linux automatically mounts the removable media in the /media directory when they are detected.


Additional Directories Under /:
-----------------------------------------

/opt 	Optional application software packages.
/sys 	Virtual pseudo-filesystem giving information about the system and the hardware. Can be used to alter system parameters and for debugging purposes. 
/srv 	Site-specific data served up by the system. Seldom used.
/tmp 	Temporary files; on some distributions erased across a reboot and/or may actually be a ramdisk in memory.
/usr 	Multi-user applications, utilities and data.

Subdirectories under /usr
------------------------------

The /usr directory contains non-essential programs and scripts (in the sense that they should not be needed to initially boot the system) and has at least the following sub-directories:
Directory name
	Usage
/usr/include 	Header files used to compile applications.
/usr/lib 	Libraries for programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
/usr/lib64 	64-bit libraries for 64-bit programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
/usr/sbin 	Non-essential system binaries, such as system daemons.
/usr/share 	Shared data used by applications, generally architecture-independent.
/usr/src 	Source code, usually for the Linux kernel.
/usr/X11R6 	X Window configuration files; generally obsolete.
/usr/local 	Data and programs specific to the local machine. Subdirectories include bin, sbin, lib, share, include, etc.
/usr/bin 	This is the primary directory of executable commands on the system.
